# Preserving Historical Media with Quantum-Resistant Signatures and Timestamps

**Safeguarding Authentic Records Against AI-Generated Distortion**

## Problem
Advancements in AI enable hyper-realistic deepfakes and fabricated media, threatening historical accuracy. Quantum computers could further compromise traditional cryptographic signatures, risking the integrity of digital archives. Without verifiable, quantum-resistant records, future generations may lose trust in historical data.

## Solution
We propose a **quantum-resistant archive** for historical media (e.g., YouTube videos) to ensure authenticity and provenance. The system:
- Downloads videos using automated scripts (Ruby, `yt-dlp`).
- Stores files in Cloudflare R2 and metadata in SQLite.
- Signs files with ML-DSA (CRYSTALS-Dilithium), a NIST-standardized, quantum-resistant algorithm using SHA-256.
- Timestamps hashes with OpenTimestamps (OTS), leveraging Bitcoin’s blockchain for free, tamper-proof records.
- Uploads signed files and OTS proofs to a verifiable R2 bucket.

This creates a secure archive where files are protected against tampering and quantum attacks, with timestamps bound to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Significance
- **Quantum Resistance**: ML-DSA signatures and SHA-256 hashing ensure security against future quantum computers.
- **Tamper-Proof Timestamps**: OTS uses Bitcoin’s immutable ledger, providing verifiable signing dates at no cost.
- **Cost-Effective**: Free timestamping via OTS and low-cost R2 storage (~$0.015/GB/month) make the system scalable.
- **Public Verifiability**: Open-source tools and public keys enable anyone to verify file integrity and timestamps.
- **Historical Preservation**: Protects authentic media for researchers and historians in an AI-driven world.

## Call to Action
Join our open-source effort to build a future-proof media archive. We need:
- **Developers**: Enhance Ruby scripts for signing, timestamping, and verification.
- **Archivists**: Curate significant media and define metadata standards.
- **Cryptographers**: Optimize ML-DSA and OTS integration for performance and security.
- **Advocates**: Promote adoption in academic and tech communities.
