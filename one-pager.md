# Preserving Historical Media with Cryptographic Signatures

**Protecting Authentic Records in an Era of AI-Generated Content**

## Problem
Advancements in AI enable the creation of indistinguishable deepfakes and fabricated media, posing a significant risk to historical accuracy. Without verifiable archives, future generations may struggle to discern authentic records from manipulated or AI-generated content, eroding trust in historical data.

## Solution
We propose a **cryptographically signed archive** of historical media (videos, images, texts) to ensure authenticity and provenance. The system:
- Downloads media (e.g., MP4s from YouTube) using automated scripts (Ruby, `yt-dlp`).
- Stores files in cloud storage (Cloudflare R2) and metadata in a SQLite database.
- Generates SHA-256 hashes of media files and signs them with RSA or ECDSA private keys.
- Optionally integrates trusted timestamping (e.g., via a Timestamping Authority or blockchain).
- Uploads signed files to a dedicated S3 bucket, enabling public verification with the corresponding public key.

This creates a tamper-proof archive where files can be verified for integrity and tied to a specific date, mitigating the risk of AI-driven historical distortion.

## Significance
- **Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures (e.g., RSA-PSS, SHA-256) ensure media files remain unaltered.
- **Provenance**: Timestamps link files to their creation or archival date, establishing historical context.
- **Scalability**: Built with open-source tools (Python, AWS, SQLite), the system is extensible and cost-effective.
- **Open Access**: Publicly verifiable signatures empower researchers, historians, and the public to trust archived media.
- **Future-Proofing**: Preserves authentic records for posterity in an AI-dominated content landscape.

## Call to Action
We seek contributors to build and scale this open-source project. Roles include:
- **Developers**: Enhance scripts for media ingestion, signing, and verification (Python, AWS SDK).
- **Archivists**: Curate historically significant media and define metadata standards.
- **Cryptographers**: Integrate trusted timestamping (TSA, blockchain) and optimize signing workflows.
- **Advocates**: Promote adoption among academic, archival, and tech communities.
